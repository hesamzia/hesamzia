# 👋 Hi, I'm Hesamedin Ziaee Ziabari  

💻 **Python Developer | Backend | Data & Automation**  

I’m a software developer with experience in **Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization**.  
My career started as a **programmer (C, C#, PHP)** and later grew into roles as an **Oracle DBA, Data Center Manager, and IT Security Manager**.  
Now, I’m back to my first passion — **coding** — with a focus on Python projects, freelancing, and open-source contributions.
